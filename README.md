Defines a new verb `fetch` for
[catkin_tools](https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools). This verb is
responsible for downloading external dependencies of the projects in a `catkin`
workspace. For now only `git` is supported. The tool is under heavy
development. Please use PyPI or download a tag for stable version.

## How to install ##
This package installs a new verb. You need to have `catkin_tools` installed.
Currently the easiest way to install this verb is from `PyPI`:
```
[sudo] pip install catkin_tools_fetch
```

## How to use ##
Should be used from a catkin workspace as follows:
```
catkin dependencies fetch --default_url YOUR_DEFAULT_URL
```

or
```
catkin deps fetch --default_url YOUR_DEFAULT_URL
```

This command will look inside the `src/` folder of the current catkin workspace
and will analyze the dependencies of `package.xml` files for each project in
this workspace. It will then try to clone the packages looking for them under
url: `YOUR_DEFAULT_URL/PACKAGE_NAME`.

Additionaly, one can explicitly define a url or a branch for a dependency in
`package.xml` file under `<export>` tag. For example:

```xml
<export>
    <git_url target="PACKAGE_NAME" url="PACKAGE_URL" branch="BRANCH_NAME" />
</export>
```

Here `PACKAGE_NAME` is the name of your package and `PACKAGE_URL` is the full
url to your package in git and `BRANCH_NAME` is the branch you want to
checkout.

Any of these can be skipped. The default will be used instead.
